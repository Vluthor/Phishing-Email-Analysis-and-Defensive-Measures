## Analysis Steps

### Email Header Analysis
The email header revealed the following suspicious details:
- **Client IP:** `173.209.60.250`
- **Sender:** `return@e-narucivanje.com`
- **Authentication:** Failed DKIM/SPF verification

- ![EMAIL HEADER](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45df4389-3640-4841-96d7-bc7f137ee046)

![HTTP](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5f0d41f-d5a3-4473-b172-942164c9b20b)


### Attachment Hash Verification
Using PowerShell, the following hashes were generated for the attachment:
- **SHA256:** `39166946342DDB09216FDAECCBDA9868E4686B293060AF5A16578999D581BFC0`
- **MD5:** `B81723980BF000CF04BF6BAB00A5548D`
- **SHA1:** `F7423AEE068BB2356543C081467D5B93DE6449DB`

![SHA 256 MD5 SHA1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a489ecb-1d5f-439c-bd44-6b5a89d24d29)

### URL Investigation
The URLs embedded in the email pointed to domains like `e-narucivanje.com`, which were flagged as malicious. They led to credential harvesting attempts disguised as legitimate forms.

2. **Web Artifact Blocking**:
   - Domain block: `e-narucivanje.com`
3. **Attachment Artifact Blocking**:
   - File hash block: `39166946342DDB09216FDAECCBDA9868E4686B293060AF5A16578999D581BFC0`
