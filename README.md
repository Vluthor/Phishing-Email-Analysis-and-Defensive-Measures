### Attachment Hash Verification
Using PowerShell, the following hashes were generated for the attachment:
- **SHA256:** `39166946342DDB09216FDAECCBDA9868E4686B293060AF5A16578999D581BFC0`
- **MD5:** `B81723980BF000CF04BF6BAB00A5548D`
- **SHA1:** `F7423AEE068BB2356543C081467D5B93DE6449DB`

1. **Email Artifact Blocking**:
   - Subject line block: `"Donâ€™t miss your chance to play."`
   - Sender address block: `return@e-narucivanje.com`
2. **Web Artifact Blocking**:
   - Domain block: `e-narucivanje.com`
3. **Attachment Artifact Blocking**:
   - File hash block: `39166946342DDB09216FDAECCBDA9868E4686B293060AF5A16578999D581BFC0`
